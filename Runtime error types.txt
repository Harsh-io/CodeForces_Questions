Runtime errors can occur in many ways! Here are the main categories of runtime errors:
1. Memory-Related Errors

Segmentation Fault / Access Violation: Accessing memory you don't own
Stack Overflow: Too much recursion or large local variables
Heap Overflow: Writing beyond allocated memory
Memory Leaks: Not freeing allocated memory (causes out-of-memory)
Null/Nullptr Dereference: Accessing null pointers
Dangling Pointers: Using freed/deleted memory

2. Array/Index Errors

Array Index Out of Bounds: Accessing arr[10] when array has only 5 elements
Negative Indexing: Using negative indices where not allowed
Buffer Overflow: Writing beyond array boundaries

3. Arithmetic Errors

Division by Zero: x / 0
Integer Overflow/Underflow: Result exceeds data type limits
Floating Point Exceptions: Invalid operations like sqrt(-1)
Modulo by Zero: x % 0

4. Type Errors

Type Mismatch: Wrong data type for operation
Invalid Type Conversion/Casting: Failed conversions
Uninitialized Variables: Using variables before assignment

5. Logic Errors

Infinite Loops: Loop never terminates
Wrong Conditions: Incorrect if/while conditions
Off-by-One Errors: Loop runs one time too many/few

6. Input/Output Errors

File Not Found: Opening non-existent files
Permission Denied: Insufficient access rights
End of File (EOF): Reading beyond file end
Invalid Input Format: Wrong data type from user

7. Resource Errors

Out of Memory: System runs out of RAM
Too Many Open Files: File descriptor limit exceeded
Network Timeout: Connection issues
Deadlock: Circular resource waiting

8. Exception/Error Handling

Uncaught Exceptions: No try-catch handling
Assertion Failures: assert() conditions fail
Runtime Library Errors: Standard library function failures
